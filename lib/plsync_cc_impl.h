     * @brief Send new frequency correction to the upstream rotator.
     *
     * The PL Sync block is designed to be used in conjunction with a rotator
     * block for frequency correction. The processing chain is expected to be
     * somewhat similar to the following:
     *
     *  AGC --> Rotator --> Symbol Sync (MF/Decimator) --> DVB-S2 PL Sync
     *
     * That is, the rotator is upstream after an intermediate symbol sync block,
     * which, in turn, implements symbol timing recovery, matched filtering, and
     * decimation. As a result, the frequency correction applied by the rotator
     * promotes better performance both on the symbol timing recovery and on the
     * DVB-S2 PL synchronization.
     *
     * In this architecture, the PL Sync block is responsible for controlling
     * the rotator frequency through a message mechanism. This function
     * implements such control.
     *
     * More specifically, this function coordinates the moment when the
     * frequency correction is supposed to change on the upstream rotator. If
     * the frequency correction was allowed to change at any moment, it could
     * change in the middle of a frame and degrade the decoding performance
     * significantly. Hence, this function attempts to schedule every change at
     * the start of a PLHEADER instead. To do so, it relies on the tag delay
     * calibrated by function `calibrate_tag_delay()`.
     *
     * @param abs_sof_idx (uint64_t) Absolute index where the SOF starts.
     * @param plframe_len (uint16_t) Corresponding PLFRAME length.
     * @param rot_freq_adj (double) Frequency adjustment to be applied.
     * @param ref_is_past_frame (bool) Whether the reference for the frequency
     *                           adjustment is the previous frame (when true) or
     *                           the frame corresponding to the most recently
     *                           handled PLHEADER (when false).
     *
     * @note A relative index is relative to the start of the current work
     * buffer. An absolute index is counted monotonically since the start of the
     * flowgraph execution. The `abs_sof_idx` parameter is an absolute index.
     *
     * @note The current architecture only processes a PLFRAME payload when both
     * the preceding and succeeding SOFs are detected. Hence, by the time the
     * n-th PLHEADER is processed, the payload behind it (payload n-1) is yet to
     * be processed. However, both the header and payload can trigger rotator
     * frequency adjustments. The header can produce a coarse frequency offset
     * update, whereas the payload can produce a fine estimate in case it has
     * pilots. Hence, care should be taken when applying parameter
     * `rot_freq_adj`.
     *
     * Regardless of which handler calls this function (header or payload), the
     * frequency adjustment is always scheduled for the start of PLHEADER
     * n+1. However, the adjustment itself can be summed to either the frequency
     * offset state at frame n-1 or frame n. The coarse estimate produced by the
     * PLHEADER handler must be added to the frequency state at frame n (at the
     * most recently processed PLHEADER). Hence, for the PLHEADER,
     * `ref_is_past_frame` must be false. In contrast, the pilot-mode fine
     * estimate produced by the payload handler must be added to the frequency
     * state of frame n-1 (i.e., the PLFRAME preceding the most recent
     * PLHEADER). In this case, `ref_is_past_frame` must be true.
