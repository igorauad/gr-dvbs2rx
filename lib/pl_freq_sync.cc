         * The frequency correction value depends on whether the frequency offset is
         * within the fine estimation range, as indicated by the coarse frequency offset
         * estimate (more specifically, by the `coarse_corrected` state). In the positive
         * case, it will be based on the most recent fine frequency offset estimate, if
         * any. Otherwise, the correction will be based on the most recent coarse
         * frequency offset estimate.
         *
         * NOTE 1: if coarse_corrected is true, that does not imply a fine frequency
         * offset estimate is available already. Check both.
         *
         * NOTE 2: when de-rotating with the fine offset, note it does not necessarily
         * correspond to the estimation based on the previous frame. It depends on whether
         * the previous frame had pilots.
         *
         * NOTE 3: this frequency correction step is only applied in open-loop mode. In
         * closed-loop, when an external block already handles the frequency corrections,
         * it would lead to undesirable behavior.
         *
         * In closed-loop, when the coarse frequency offset estimation period is
         * non-unitary, the problem is that the derotation is not required in all frames.
         * For example, when the estimation period is 2, one frame leads to a new
         * estimate, while the other receives the correction due to the preceding
         * estimate, according to the architecture adopted by the PL Sync block. For
         * instance, suppose four consecutive frames, [F0, F1, F2, F3]. After F1, a new
         * coarse frequency offset estimate is produced and scheduled for correction at
         * the start of F2. Hence, assuming an ideal estimate and correction, frame F2 no
         * longer experiences the frequency offset estimated on F1. However, when
         * processing F2, the most recent coarse frequency offset estimate is still that
         * of F1, so the derotation would be based on F1, which would be clearly wrong. To
         * avoid this, the de-rotation should only be applied when a new coarse frequency
         * offset estimate is produced. In the example, it would be applied at frames F1
         * and F3 only, but not on F0 and F2.
         *
         * To complicate things further, the fine offset estimations and corrections apply
         * on different frames (with a different delay). For example, assume the same
         * sequence of four frames, that the synchronizer is already in coarse-corrected
         * state, and that all frames contain pilot blocks. In this case, frame F0 leads
         * to a new fine offset estimate, but which is only applied at the start of frame
         * F2 (two frames later). When the PLHEADER of F2 is processed, the most recent
         * fine offset estimate will be that due to F1, but F2 receives the frequency
         * correction due to the F0 estimate, so the derotation due to the F1 estimate
         * does not make sense. In this case, the appropriate correction value would be
         * "f_F1 - f_F0", i.e., the difference between the estimate due to F1 and the
         * estimate due to F0.
         *
         * In both cases, further logic would be required to decide whether or not to
         * apply derotation here in closed-loop mode, or to decide which frequency
         * correction to apply. To avoid the extra complexity, we assume the benefit from
         * this derotation is negligible in closed-loop, assuming the frequency correction
         * eventually converges to an accurate value.
